Notes:-

HTML : Tags : DOM OBJECT : Document Query, Polulate or Edit by: by name, id, class etc. , can be rendered using Java Script.
However you cant save them these rendered HTML , you may print them in console logs however.

Node can be used to run js code. NPM , install libraries using npm install, make sure to have the settings for npm.
Node is not client side, Its a server side. Dont expect to call javascript node libraries to be called using require keyword in your NodeJS environmnet.
You will get this error: “require” is not defined error- javascript

Why JS -> Its Async -> so that browser does not hang when you make a query in backend -> 
Promise -> 3 states -> fullfilled, rejected, pending.
for example , fetch method. 

Example code:-

let targets = fetch(apiserver).then(data => console.log(data)).catch(err => console.log(err));
Also note that above is equivalent of below

fetch(apiserver).then(function (data) {console.log(data)}).catch(function(err){console.log(err)});

You expect an output from Async JS function, you may not get it. what would you get is : "Promise { <pending> }"

You have to call the method on the promise object. These methods are:- .then, .catch
You can run a webserver using expressJS http package or python django or flask.
