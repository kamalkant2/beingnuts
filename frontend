Notes:-

HTML : Tags : DOM OBJECT : Document Query, Polulate or Edit by: by name, id, class etc. , can be rendered using Java Script.
Tag can have name or id or class , so that they can be located within html.
we have metadata in html as well. like pagename, encoding etc.
Web scrapping works on same fundamentals. 
CSS is to style the html. Try to have Div and containers for better control in html pages. we can have css in html defined as well like js can be embed in script tag.
we can add jquery or bootstrap to have some prebulilt syles and functions to be used.

However you cant save them these rendered HTML , you may print them in console logs however.

Functions defined in javascript can be invoked in response to an event in browser like click, hover etc.
These function can change the html view by rendering it or can call a backend query to db as well. 

Node can be used to run js code. NPM , install libraries using npm install, make sure to have the settings for npm.
Node is not client side, Its a server side. Dont expect to call javascript node libraries to be called using require keyword in your NodeJS environmnet.
You will get this error: “require” is not defined error- javascript

Why JS -> Its Async -> so that browser does not hang when you make a query in backend -> 
Promise -> 3 states -> fullfilled, rejected, pending.
for example , fetch method. 

Example code:-

let targets = fetch(apiserver).then(data => console.log(data)).catch(err => console.log(err));
Also note that above is equivalent of below

fetch(apiserver).then(function (data) {console.log(data)}).catch(function(err){console.log(err)});

You expect an output from Async JS function, you may not get it. what would you get is : "Promise { <pending> }"

You have to call the method on the promise object. These methods are:- .then, .catch
You can run a webserver using expressJS http package or python django or flask. 

TS. As node js is functional in nature. the code become more complex to be written. we can write typescript and complile it to javascript. 
Typescript allow classes, inheritence and many other object oriented features.
